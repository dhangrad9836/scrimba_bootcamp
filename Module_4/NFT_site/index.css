Challenge:
1. Create a body selector.
2. Set the base font size and text color to 
   the values given on the slide.

Challenge:
1. Create a "header" selector.
2. Give it its background color.
3. What CSS property do you need to use to remove
   the annoying white space at the top? Give this 
   property a value of 45px top and bottom.
3. Create selectors for the h1 and h3 elements.
4. Assign the correct margins, size & colors to h1
   and h3.
At the end of the challenge, the h1 and h3 will 
still be up right up against the left-hand edge of 
the browser. That is fine for now.
