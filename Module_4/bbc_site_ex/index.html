				<h2>Dog stuck to ceiling after inhaling helium</h2>
				<p>
					Bernard, a one-year-old Corgi, inhaled the gas from balloons at a child's birthday party. He has now been pressed against the ceiling of his owner's house on the outskirts of Edinburgh for 12 hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					Local vet Levi Tate told the BBC that this is more common than people think. "In 1954 ChiChi, a Chihuahua from Mexico City, floated away
					from his back garden. He landed safe and well three days later in a park in Phoenix, Arizona."
